# quality-gate: a code change is not finished until its owner proved it and
# quality-reviewer read it.
# Only files THIS session edited count: PostToolUse (Edit/Write/MultiEdit/
# NotebookEdit, subagents included) appends each path to a per-session log.
# Files changed only through Bash are not seen.
# Stop compares those files against the commit the session started from, so a
# change committed inside the turn is still checked. It then looks in the
# transcript, from the prompt that started the change, for:
#   - an Agent call with subagent_type quality-reviewer, and
#   - for each owner of a changed api/, web/ or acceptance/ file
#     (.claude/OWNERS.md), that owner agent or its verify skill.
#   - on a high-risk change (an access-owner or money-owner file, a migration
#     or a CI workflow): the reviewer agent and the
#     security-review skill too, and the user is told it needs their review.
# Missing evidence blocks the stop, up to 3 times per change; then the stop is
# let through and the user is told what was skipped. Once the evidence is there
# the current diff is recorded, so fixes made from the review are not reviewed
# again.
# UserPromptSubmit stamps the turn's start and reminds the agent of the routes
# (feature, bug, review).
# SessionStart resets the log only on a fresh start: compact and resume keep it.
# QUALITY_GATE_OFF=1 turns it off.
# The CODE globs below are also the agent's file list (quality-reviewer.md).
