"""Redis client for ephemeral state only: rate-limit counters and the live-update bus (ADR 0009).

Copied from OSCE `platform-api`. Nothing durable lives here; durable work goes
through Postgres and the job queue. Short timeouts keep a Redis outage from
stalling requests; callers treat `None` as "Redis is off" and degrade.
